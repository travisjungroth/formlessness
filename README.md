# Formlessness

>Form is formlessness, formlessness is form.

--_The Heart Sutra_

Formlessness is a Python library for handling the backend work of web forms. It helps with serialization, validation and generating the form specification for the frontend.

## Motivations

 * Easier dynamic generation of everything form related.
 * Simple representation of complex validation logic.
 * High extendability.
