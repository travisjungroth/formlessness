# Contributing to Formlessness

This is a new project and things will change quickly.

## How to help

Adding a feature, test, bugfix or doc will have essentially the same workflow.

Find something in [issues](https://github.com/travisjungroth/formlessness/issues) or open one. There are [good first issues](https://github.com/travisjungroth/formlessness/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Open a PR. There are strict formatters. If there are any problems, you may get an automatic commit on top of yours fixing them.

The only commits allowed on `main` are squashed commits via PR. 

1. Your commit on `main` won't have you listed as the author.
2. You will be listed as a co-author, which GitHub recognizes.

I'll make changes as-needed on PRs before pulling them in, instead of making suggestions.
